I was always a bubbly sort of a person. No worries, chill, stupid talks, my life in a nutshell.

I met a guy totally opposite to my personality. A nerd, serious n shy.

This guy brought tides to my life. (seriously)

I still can't figure him out. But at least I have learnt to accept him d way he is.

Coz u don fall in luv wid mirrors.

It seems to b very easy to let anyone in, but to fit pieces of d puzzle is always difficult. Don force a person to change coz u want, let him grow frm his mistakes so tht he feels d need.

N always remember talk n listen, never shout or ignore.

Give tym to him. He too might not lyk somethings in u as a person but he is trying.
